# P3 Q4: Interpret the variance fractions and dimensionality reduction tradeoff.
# YOUR ANSWER HERE
# PC1 explains approximately 89.4% of the total variance, while PC2 explains approximately 10.6%.
# Therefore, the dataset could be reduced from two dimensions to one by retaining only PC1 while
# preserving most of the variance. This demonstrates the trade-off in dimensionality reduction: using
# fewer dimensions simplifies the representation but results in some loss of information, with
# approximately 10.6% of the variance discarded in this case.

# Tasks completed: all of Parts 1 to 3. Derivations and proofs are in PDF, all functions are implemented in this file, 
# figures are saved as: pca_plots.png.
# Collaborations : no classmates 
# AI: per course policy; conversation log submitted to Canvas, I used claude to walk through the derivations step by step, explain steps I didn't
# understand (e.g. summation index notation, the E[X^2] calculation), and provide basic process to approach functions for this file 
# understand, and the code for the functions in this file, which I implemented, debugged, and checked against my hand calculations.
# Other resources: CSE 242 Lecture 1-3 slides, NumPy and Matplotlib docs.
